🍸 No Sponsors, No Agendas, Just Networking: Say goodbye to the typical, stiff networking events. Here, there are no sponsors, no speakers – just you, your peers, and the flowing exchange of ideas. It's networking at its purest, driven by community spirit.

🏙️ Downtown Vibes: Set in the heart of Vancouver, our gatherings are accessible by transit from outside of the city. 

⏰ Flexibility is Key: We kick off at 5:30 PM, but this isn't your strict 9-to-5. Stay as long or as little as you like. People typically stay till about 7:30 before the crowd starts thinning. There is usually still a small group past 9pm that goes for dinner. Our casual format means you can come and go as it suits you.

🍹 Support the Venue: In lieu of a fee, we encourage you to grab a drink or show your appreciation to our gracious hosts with a tip. It’s our way of saying thanks and ensuring these gatherings continue to thrive.

🗣️ Talk About Anything & Everything: From the latest in data science to the adventures of your latest hike, the conversation topics are limitless. The only agenda here is to forge genuine connections.

🤝 Be Part of Our Community: Every attendee is a valued member of our community. Your presence and participation are what make these events a success. Share the event, bring a friend, or help us find the next great venue.
